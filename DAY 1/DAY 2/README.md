## Arithmeticall operations
The arithmeticall operations are basic mathematics perfomed in the order of parenthisis,exponentiation, multiplication and division, addition and subtraction.(PEMDAS)
# parenthisis - ( )
t = (9 + 9)
# exponentiation - **
e = 9**5
# multiplication - * 
m = 8*9
# division - / 
d = 9/8
# addition - +
a = 7 + 9
# subtraction - - 
s = 7 - 6
